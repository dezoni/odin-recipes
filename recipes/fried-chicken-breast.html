        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fried chicken breast that is exceptionally tasty, tender and juicy. The best part is it requires only 6 minutes of frying time.</p>
        <p>Frying full chicken breasts is usually a problem because lean breasts tend to dry out by the time they cook all the way through. This results in a dry, chalky texture that no one likes. Thankfully, I just discovered a method that allows frying full breasts in a matter of minutes and the meat comes out exceptionally tasty, tender and juicy.</p>
